# de1-flow-calibration-estimation
``` 
(venv) de1-flow-calibration-estimation> python -m flowcorrection
```
Pick a shot file in the dialog, done!

Sample shot files are in the example directory.

![flowcorrection](figure.png)

Move window slider (horizontal one) to desired position, then adjust correction slider (vertical one) to see if corrected flow well-fits measured weight within the window.

Use the correction value just found as a starting point finding flow calibration value in the DE1 app.

Hope this would help!
